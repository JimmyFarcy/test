You have an array of data points, each point is represented as three floating point number (x,y,z).

The API does not assume that the array only contains X,Y,Z. You might have X,Y,Z,color,etc. etc.

That is why you are allowed to specific a stride. However, in the default case of an array of floating point numbers, int the format of x1,y1,z1,x2,y2,z2,x3,y3,z3,

Then the stride, between each data point is sizeof(float)*3.

Get it?

Exmaple:

float points[9] =
{
1, 1, 1,
3, 2, 4,
8, 9, 10
};

and you want the result stored in the following plane:

float plane[4];

Then call:

computeBestFitPlane(3,
points,
sizeof(float)*3,
0,0,plane);

Holy crap, how much easier could it be?
